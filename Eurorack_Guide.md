# Eurorack Guidelines

AWG follows the [Doepfer standard](http://www.doepfer.de/a100_man/a100m_e.htm).

## Dimensions

### Panel Height

  * 128.5 mm

> Module front panels are 3U high (133.4 mm). The final height of the front panels is a bit less than 133.4 mm as the rim of the mounting rails has to taken into consideration. Consequently the final height is 128.5mm.

### PCB Available Height

  * 106.5 mm

> PCB height is panel height minus 11 mm for each rail (top and bottom)

### Panel Width

  * Floor( HP * 5.08 mm )

> Width is measured in HP. (1 HP = 5.08 mm) The actual width of a front panel is a few tenth of a mm less than the calculated value

| HP   | Calculated Width (mm) | actual width (mm) |
