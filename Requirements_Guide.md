# Requirements Guide

It is important to clearly define the requirements of a module. The requirements document defines our goals in specific, quantifiable units as described by a few simple rules. Requirements can change over time and we track these inside the `requirements.md` document in the projects `docs` folder. Please use good commit messages as this will create nice timeline of needs as they change.

## 1. Requirement Numbers

Upon release/commit of requirements entry, requirement #’s will “lock”. 
If a requirement is no longer applicable to the product the requirement number shall be 
deleted as well and any additional requirements shall be added in sequential order.

## 2. Requirement Definitions

  * **SHALL** – An absolute requirement of the specification
  * **SHALL NOT** – An absolute prohibition of the specification
  * **SHOULD** – Used to convey something that is desired but not required.
  * **SHOULD NOT** – Used to convey something that is undesirable but not prohibited.
  * **WILL** – Used to convey information on how something is used but is not a requirement.
  * **MAY** – Used to convey something that is permissible but not required.

## 3. Requirements
 
Avoid trying to define a solution, as this will narrow the conceptual design and suppress creativity. 
Ideally the RD phase is a discovery phase were engineering and marketing exchange ideas on what 
is possible and what the customer wants.

  * Focus on WHAT, not HOW. Do not state requirements as a solution, or how to achieve that requirement.
  * Only include requirements that are ESSENTIAL to success of the product.
  * Only include requirements that are objective and can be tested and / or confirmed.
  * Do not include the same requirement in more than one section of the document.

## 4. Verification Types

  * **INSPECT** – Inspection is the nondestructive examination of a product using one or more of the five senses (visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, taste). It may include simple physical manipulation and measurements.
  * **DEMO** – Demonstration is the manipulation of the product or system as it is intended to be used to verify that the results are as planned or expected.
  * **TEST** – Test is the verification of a product or system using a controlled and predefined series of inputs, data, or stimuli to ensure that the product or system will produce a very specific and predefined output as specified by the requirements.
  * **ANALYSE** – Analysis is the verification of a product or system using models, calculations and testing equipment.
