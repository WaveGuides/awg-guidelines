# AWG BOM Guide

This guide will run you through our standard Bills of Materials or BOM elements.

The BOM or Bill of Materials is saved inside the projects `docs` folder and can be seen as a simple _parts list_. It's only use is to communicate the components needed to complete a build. It does not deal with cost and/or lead-times.

> a _chart_ may be included in the **Notes** section of the BOM.

## Part \#
The Part Number is a unique ID that identifies a single component in the Bill of Materials. This is a local number so we can change manufacturer without losing reference to the part.

> Using standard row ID numbers is acceptable as long as you _freeze_ them. Meaning you can't re-use a previous defined ID.

## Qty
The quantity column you can specify the quantity (count) of the parts needed to build the module.

## Type
The type of component (Resistor, potentiometer, diode)

## Manufacturer
The manufacturer of the part.

## Man. Part \#
The Part Number of the manufacturer.

## Distributer
The chosen distributer of the part.

## Dist. Part \#
The Part Number of the distributer.

## Description
Description of the part.

## Comments
Any comments you might have.
