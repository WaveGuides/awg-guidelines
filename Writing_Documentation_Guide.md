# AWG Writing Documentation

Good projects have good documentation. We chose to write all our documentation in [Markdown format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) so it looks good in the repository, can be read as plain text in any terminal, but also easily transformed into a printed manual as well.

Most things are really easy, but some things like tables are a little more awkward to make look good in plain text. Either way, life get's a lot better with some good tools. Below a list of some of our favourite tools. (There are many, many more)

# Dedicated tools

  * [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com)
  * [Quiver](http://happenapps.com/#quiver)
  * [TableFlip](http://tableflipapp.com)
  * [Typora](https://typora.io)

# Plugins for code editors

Patch your code editor with a [Markdown Table Formatter](https://github.com/alanwsmith/markdown_table_formatter)

  * [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-table-formatter-z)
  * [Sublime Text](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Markdown%20Table%20Formatter)

Or use the Markdown table scripts for [BBEdit](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2012/11/markdown-table-scripts-for-bbedit/) or [TextMate](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2012/03/improved-markdown-table-commands-for-textmate/)
